# Beginners-Python-Taskmanager
 My very first Python project! A very simple task manager to keep track of all your daily duties. You can add new tasks, mark them as done or delete them altogether, and your task list will remain saved even if tou exit the program - so it will be available when you come to look back at it. I used Colorama to make it more appealing.
