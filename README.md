# Beginners-Python-Taskmanager
 My very first Python project! 
 A very simple task manager to keep track of all your daily duties. 
 You can add new tasks, mark them as done or delete them altogether, and your task list will remain saved even if tou exit the program - so it will be available when you come to look back at it. 
 I used Colorama to make it more appealing.
 
 A file will be created in your device the first time you add a task to the list. That way, every time you start the code, the file will be imported and the contents loaded,
 so you can check you task list whenever you like.
 
 
 Please beware that this is just a silly program intended for programming practice only.
 
 Anyway, I hope you like it.
